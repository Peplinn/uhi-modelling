    "# UHI Modelling V2\n",
    "\n",
    "I am attempting a revised workflow for modelling UHI.\n",
    "First, the model is now going to include weather variables obtained from OpenMeteo. The data will then be aggregated with the Landsat data and used to build the model with the workflow below:  \n",
    "1. Identify the world's climates from an authority (like the Trewartha climate classification).\n",
    "2. Get substantial satellite (which will eventually include those those climate categories) and weather data on countries in those regions across the months (seasons) in a particular year.\n",
    "3. Train a model on the data, implementing train-validation-test split, and predict UHI intensity on the test set.\n",
    "4. Group the test examples by climate and compute the RMSE scores across the climates.\n",
    "5. Cluster the UHI features to identify the types and categories of UHI.\n",
    "6. Then I, human, assess the errors and prediction accuracies across each manufactured UHI cluster and how they vary across climates.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\"This project predicts urban heat island intensity using satellite and environmental data and evaluates how prediction reliability and errors vary across global climates and urban thermal types.\"***"
